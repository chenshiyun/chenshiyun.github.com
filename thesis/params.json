According to the original survey data of two different types, we estimate the parameters of income distribution using **Simulated Annealing Algorithm** and **Monte Carlo Method**. By analyzing the distribution figures, we can draw the conclusion as follows. Since 2005, both urban and rural income has been upgraded prevalently with highly dispersion. The percentage of the high-income families is growing larger while that of the low-income families is growing smaller, and there’s no polarization tendency. We conclude that the difference between urban and rural income is definitely large through comparison. \r\n\r\nThen, the **Hermite interpolation** was used to compare the urban and rural income difference among eastern, middle and western China. The results show that, for cities, average family income in eastern China is much higher than that in any other region, but that in middle and western China are becoming more and more congruent; for countries, the income difference between any two regions is broadening.\r\n\r\nHence, we conclude that the income difference between either city and country or different regions is extending.\r\n\r\n##Result Graphs\r\n![alt text](image/fig1.jpg \"Rural Income\")\r\n\r\nFig1 2005、2009、2010、2011 Rural Income Distribution\r\n\r\n![alt text](image/fig2.jpg \"Urban Income\")\r\n\r\nFig2 2005、2009、2010、2011 Urban Income Distribution\r\n\r\n![alt text](image/fig3.jpg \"Comparison\")\r\n\r\nFig3 Urban Income Gap between Eastern, Middle and Western China\r\n\r\n![alt text](image/fig3.jpg \"Comparison\")\r\n\r\nFig4 Rural Income Gap between Eastern, Middle and Western China\r\n\r\n##Reference\r\n［1］Ormoneit, D. and H.
